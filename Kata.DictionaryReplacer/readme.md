This kata is about making a simple string replacer. It is inspired by Corey Haines Lightning talk about practicing. (aac2009.confreaks.com/06-feb-2009-20-30-lightning-talk-under-your-fingers-corey-haines.html)
Create a method that takes a string and a dictionary, and replaces every key in the dictionary pre and suffixed with a dollar sign, with the corresponding value from the Dictionary.

Tests

input : "", dict empty, output:""

input : "$temp$", dict ["temp", "temporary"], output: "temporary"

input : "$temp$ here comes the name $name$", dict ["temp", "temporary"] ["name", "John Doe"], output : "temporary here comes the name John Doe"
